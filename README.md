# gallerize

Photo gallery. Fetch public domain photos from an API and creates a gallery of thumbnails with links to full res images. Created with React, Redux toolkit, React Router and Hooks.

Under development. Clone and run npm start to check out the dev version. Currently gallery view and individual image pages are functioning using photos from JSONPlaceholder API.

Todo:

- Styling
- Navigation
- Use a different API for real photos ([Openverse](https://wordpress.org/openverse/)?)
- Search by keyword
